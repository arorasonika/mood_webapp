## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* Google Cloud Account & Firebase Project (for Firestore)
* Twilio Account or similar SMS provider account
* Git for version control

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd mindful-moments # Or your chosen project directory name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Firebase Credentials:**
    * Download your Firebase service account key JSON file from your Firebase project settings.
    * Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to the path of this JSON file:
        ```bash
        # For macOS/Linux (add to your .bashrc or .zshrc for persistence)
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json"

        # For Windows (PowerShell)
        $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\serviceAccountKey.json"
        ```
    * Alternatively, you can configure the Firestore client directly in your application code if preferred for local development (not recommended for production).

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add necessary configurations (Flask will need `python-dotenv` package to load this, or you can set them manually):
    ```env
    FLASK_APP=app.py  # Or your main Flask application file
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY='your_very_secret_key_here'

    # Example for Twilio (if used)
    # TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID='your_twilio_account_sid'
    # TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN='your_twilio_auth_token'
    # TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER='+1234567890'
    ```

6.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the port specified).
